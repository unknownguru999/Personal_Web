## Overview

We designed a system for people to donate Aaroma Food Cards instead of cash to the needy. This ensures the donation reaches the right hands instead of funding the beggar's mafia. We found out that when people give cash to the needy children, it is taken away by their 'Parents' to buy intoxicants. Aaroma Food card ensures that the donation given by the people fills empty stomachs!

## Aaroma Card

One can distribute these food card worth 20 rupees amongst the needy. The needy can then give these cards to food joints associated with us and receive food worth of that cost without paying any money. The money is reimbursed to the shops by us.
