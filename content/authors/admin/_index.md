I am a final year undergraduate student pursuing my Bachelors of Technology in Information Technology from Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute, India. Ever since my first year in college, I have been keenly interested in the field of Machine learning. Our increased ability at cross-language interaction by building efficient lexical semantic analyzers and multi-variety models is what draws me to this field immensely.  To pursue my research interests, I tried my hands on interesting ML problem statements in the Centre of Excellence, the research incubator of VJTI, accoladed as the Best Incubator of India as of 2020. I wish to further explore opportunities in this domain that would efficiently change the way people communicate. 

In addition to this, I have a keen interest in music. I am a music aficionado at heart and the days I seem to hit the wrong note, my guitar helps me harmonize. Being well versed with 4 musical instruments, my days aren't complete without an element of music. I also greatly enjoy listening to podcasts centred around Artificial Intelligence and experts' opinions on such subjects.
